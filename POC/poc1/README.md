# Overview

POC1 is about attaching an IMU sensor to an M5StampS3 and making this a foundational component of the RockeTone architecture.  It also includes a simple NFC concept for getting rocket launch information or possibly even collecting the rocket data (in the future).

## Goals

- Verify power consumption
- Verify network range: test ESP-NOW, BLE
- Verify Temperature
- Build a prototype visual dashboard for sensors (maybe use Project MagNET)
- Get an estimated BOM cost for rough design
- Feed above input into POC2, which will be about creating a board and software to make the first RockeTone sensors.

## PoC Features

- A visual viewer of the 9DOF sensor using browser
- An NFC tap concept to collect rocket launch data.
